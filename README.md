Emotion Recognition		and Expression	in	Text
Emotions are universal, but the way we express them varies from culture to culture. This project aims to create a system that takes into consideration these variations in order to accurately recognize emotions in text.
Recognizing and expressing emotions across multiple languages involves understanding linguistic and cultural variations in emotional expression. This project proposes a model that accurately recognizes and expresses emotions in text across diverse languages.
